Deep Investigation of Neutral Gas Origins (DINGO) is an HI pencile-beam survey using ASKAP. This is an __unnoficial LaTeX teplate__ for presentations about DINGO related science.

The template created with a quick and dirty attitude, thus the style file not constructed well and do not specify everithing, only some basic enviroments. For some tricky LaTeXpresentations, one have to modify the style file to get acceptable looking slides, but using simple slides the template works well. See the style slides for some details!
